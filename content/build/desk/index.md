A modern computer desk made from floorboard timbers.

This desk is made up of;
- 85x22mm lengths of iron bark floorboards
- 90X20mm merbau flooring
- 45x18 merbau slats

Sort the ironbark floorboard by colour. Wet each panel to see its final colour and match it to it's adjacent panel.

Cut the merbau 45x20mm slats to length. It supports the laminate panel. Give it a preliminary primer and coat of automotive duplicolor matte black as it is much easier than painting after assembly.

Laminate each length together with glue and pocket holes on the underside. 
Then screw to the underside merbau supports. Use 8g 30mm screws, be sure to use large countersunk pilot holes as ironbark will snap screws easily.

Fix the legs. 2x 75mm 14g screws are screwed through the top into each leg. A horizontal beam runs across each leg.
Spray the legs with another coat of matte automotive paint to even it out Recommend using washi tape as it holds lines much better than generic masking tape.
Give the underside a couple coats of Danish oil.
Flip the table over and apply danish oil to the top surface.
