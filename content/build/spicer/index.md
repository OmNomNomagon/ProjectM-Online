A test tube spice rack made from Tasmanian oak.
Holds 18 different spices in 25x150mm test tubes

The vertical portions are made up of the 19mm oak. A band saw is used to make the joint.
The top horizontal portion is made of the 19mm oak. 27mm holes are spaced out in 40mm increments. Use a drill press for the most accurate results.
The bottom horizontal mean is a sandwich of two 12mm lengths. The topmost length has matching hole spacings.
