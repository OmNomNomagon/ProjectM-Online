This is a Remix of Balazar's Open Alpha with bass ports. This version contains a strengthened and modified output jack that allows for the use of 2.5 and 3.5mm connectors instead of the standard Hirose connector. The Hirose connectors can be hard to source and the standard the 2.5mm connector an easy to find and more versatile substitute. 

The connector wall is thickened by 0.2mm. The output hole diameter is 5.9mm and perfectly fits the following Lumberg 3.5mm connector.
