This coffee table was made from timber from an old redgum shop table and merbau 35x35mm lengths.

The original table is pulled apart.

Checked what a danish oil finish would look like with a small sample.

The table top is made up of the leg sections of the old table. Use a table saw to split the legs into 35 x 80 x 800 lengths.
Sand each of the 4 lengths till they are reasonable similar to eachother.
Old holes can be filled up with araldyte and coffee grounds. 
Laminate together and clamp.
Add 3 layers of danish oil spaced a day apart

Wait a week then apply 4-5 layers of oil based satin wipe on poly. Wait 8-12 hours between each coat.

Build a cubic leg structure on lengths of 34mm merbau lengths.

Prior to adding the legs, paint them in primer and then 2 layers of duplicolour matte black automotive paint. This gives the wood a powedered steel like appearance.
