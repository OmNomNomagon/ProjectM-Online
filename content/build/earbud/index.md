This thing will turn your whisky bottles into a classy headphone stand.
It is a redesign of my original [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1729644). This one includes two rings for added stability and better looks compared to the original. 

Most Whiskeys bottles will fit withing the two tapered rings
The Upper ring around the cap tapers between 24-38mm.
The Lower ring around the neck tapers between 38-43mm

I've confirmed that this will fit on the following Whisky bottles:
Lapphroaig
Lagavulin
Yamasaki
Jack Daniels
Glenfiddich
Cragganmore
Ardberg
Glenlivet
Glenmorangie

Enjoy.
