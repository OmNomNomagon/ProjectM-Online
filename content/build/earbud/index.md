An earphone holder with modern styling.
Lots of entry points to secure the buds and jack.

Comes in three versions.
Double sided with a flat base
Double sided with a tapered base
Single sided with a flat base.

The stock sizes should fit most earphones and buds perfectly. You may need to increase or decrease the %size depending on if your buds are larger or smaller than most.


Enjoy.
