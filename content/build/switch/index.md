This thing keeps all of your game cards close and easily accessible on your switch dock. It is much easier than constantly dealing with a stack of game cases.

It is available in two variants. 
The straight version (like a scrabble letter holder), will hold up to 7 cards.
The angled version holds up to 9 cards.
