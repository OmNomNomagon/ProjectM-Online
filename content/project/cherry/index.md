A tool to speed up opening of Cherry MX mechanical keyboard switches and similar clones. Makes keyboard modding a lot easier, especially when lubing or switching springs.

This is a redesign of the original found here http://kbdlab.co.kr/index.php?mid=board_etc&search_target=nick_name&search_keyword=%EC%95%84%EC%B9%A8%EC%97%90%E2%84%A2&document_srl=101589.

I found the original design printed in PLA would break after opening 30 or so switches. This redesigned one is strengthen and I was to open and disassemble 200 switches without it breaking.

As usual this wont work on switches soldered to a plate, but works with loose switches.
