This is a remix of Keagan_Exsteen's excellent poly planter.

The original tapers inwards at the top which made it unsuitble for a number of plants. This one tapers outward which makes it perfect for many types of succulents and is much easier to handle when planting.

The original also had a number of geometry issues which caused it to print differently depending on the slicer. I repaired it and included a normal (96x96x48mm) and a mini (65x65x35mm) size.



### Changelog

1.1. Added a solid model for vase mode printing.
