This is an enclosure to combine a Sonoff R2 Basic RF switch and usb dual output charger.
The USB charger used is a cheap and easy to source YJ-128. The PCB's for both the Sonoff and charger are press fit into the base. 

The design features a prominent button for on/off and resetting the switch, strain relief for the input cable, and a thin port where the indicator light can shine through.

This device is perfect for pairing with my [Converging LED Floor Lamp project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4166209)
