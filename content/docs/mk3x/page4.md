Finalize the 380mm underside crossbeam.

Take the temp front 30x30 corner bracket off the underside crossbeam. Sandwich a 16mm M5 screw into a corner 30x30 bracket, the **Tower Bottom Brackets Crossover Merge** part, the steel plate bracket into the crossbeam extrusion and the base part.

On each side of the 380mm crossbeam attach the vertical 355mm extrusions.
This should be attached with a corner 30x30 bracket, and the **Tower Bottom Brackets Crossover Merge** parts.

On the back of the vertical extrusions install the **Z Axis Motor Bottom Right** and **Z Axis Motor Bottom Left** parts. The bottom of those parts should be exactly 44mm from the base of the printer.

![Note the y idler and y motor parts are on backwards here](https://github.com/OmNomNomagon/ReDuplicator-MK2sx/blob/master/Pics/3%20Tower%20Frame/Frame3.jpg?raw=true)
NOTE!: The  y idler and motor mount are on the wrong side here. swap them!

Install The 320mm Z Rods in the **Z Axis motor** parts. Align the rods flush with the bottom of the motor mount. Use a **Z-Rod securer** to secure the rod. This part should contain a hert-sert part with a 16mm M3 screw to tighten it to the rod. Mount the securer to the motor parts with a 12mm M3 screw and a 16mm M3 screw where it also mounts to the z-motor astrosyn dampener. Mount the other side of the Z-motor with a 12mm M3.
