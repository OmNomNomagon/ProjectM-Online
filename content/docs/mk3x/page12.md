Run the main Cable between the rear legs. Install the **Cable Base Holder** under the printer, between the rear legs with a 12mm M5 and t-nut. Lock in the cable using the conduit fitting part and 2x 8-12mm M3 screws.

The Y-axis endstop is screwed onto the **Y Axis Rod Holder Right & Endstop** part. If an autoleveling sensor is being used no Z-endstop is required, otherwise the **Z-EndStop** part is screwed directly into the tower extrusion and cabibrated to your bed level. 

Connect the motors, and endstop cables. Run these cables through the extrusion channels. Where possible use the **Cable Guide Drop In X2-4** and **Cable Guide Slide In X2-4** parts to lock these cables into the channels.

Modify the cable chain so that it will work with our new printer dimensions. The vertical chain should contain 22 links + the 2 end links. The horizontally moving chain should contain 25 links + the two end links. The last 2 links in this chain should be reversed, to reduce the stain on the cables.

The X-Axis endstop is now mounted underneath the **X-axis Idler Part**. The endstop should be disconnected and the wire pulled out of the top cable chain length so that it only passed through the bottom cable chain. This reduces the weight and strain on the x-axis.

From v1.3 a new cable routing method is preferred. The cables can be routed from the base to the hotend using the **Cable Guide Bottom Mount 360** to hold the bottom of the vertical cable chain.

The top of the vertical drag chain should connect to **Cable Guide Alternate - Motor Mount 360** with 2x 8mm countersunk m3 screws. This part requires the use of 4 heat serts. It clips onto the X motor and secured with a 25mm m3 screw and nylock. The bottom of the horizontal drag chain connects to this part and the other end can be screwed directly into the back of the extruder carriage.

In the pic above you can make out the two reversed chain links.
The finalized cabling should looks something like this.

Congratulations, your printer is now complete. with any luck it looks like this.
